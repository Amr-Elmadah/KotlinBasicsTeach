# KotlinBasicsTeach
The user story was a task in an interview in a Germany company (Required in Java), but now I implemented it in kotlin also
I decided that to help the developers to learn kotlin in a fast way, That module has (adapters - retrofit - flavors) in kotlin
you can check the same task in Java to differentiate between kotlin and java here : https://github.com/Amr-Elmadah/CatFact

The code is implemented in MVP (Model View Presenter) design pattern (you can learn it also)

I'm still facing a problem with butterknife library of Jake Wharton with kotlin so I use the default way in initiate the
variables of controllers.

The goal of the task wasn't to check the powerful of features as you can see there's no features, it was to check the style of the code.
